Analog Frontend Circuit Design for an Audio Amplifier

This project focuses on the design and development of an Analog Frontend Circuit that integrates a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA), an 8-bit Successive Approximation Register ADC (SAR-ADC), and a Bandgap Reference (BGR). The objective is to create a high-precision, low-power analog signal processing system suitable for applications requiring accurate amplification, filtering, and analog-to-digital conversion.

System Overview

The circuit takes an analog input signal, conditions it using a PGA, filters unwanted high-frequency noise through an active low-pass filter, and then converts it into a digital format using an 8-bit SAR-ADC. A bandgap reference ensures a stable voltage supply for consistent performance.

Key Components and Design

Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA)

*Configured as an inverting operational amplifier with resistive feedback.
*Provides eight selectable gain settings (0 dB to 21 dB in 3 dB steps) through a digitally controlled resistor network.
*Includes an active low-pass filter to suppress high-frequency noise before ADC conversion.

8-bit Successive Approximation Register ADC (SAR-ADC)

*Converts the conditioned analog signal into a digital output using a capacitor-based charge redistribution DAC.
*Uses a binary search algorithm to approximate the input voltage efficiently.
*Optimized for low-power operation while maintaining high accuracy.

Bandgap Reference (BGR)

*Generates a precise and temperature-stable reference voltage using a Brokaw cell architecture.
*Provides a 1.205V reference, which is crucial for maintaining accurate signal amplification and ADC conversions.
